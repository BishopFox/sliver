// According to ANSI (section 2.2.4.2), the values below must be usable by
// #if preprocessing directives.  Additionally, the expression must have the
// same type as would an expression that is an object of the corresponding
// type converted according to the integral promotions.  The subtraction for
// INT_MIN, etc., is so the value is not unsigned; e.g., 0x80000000 is an
// unsigned int for 32-bit two's complement ANSI compilers (section 3.1.3.2).

// max value for an unsigned long long

// Quads and longs are the same on the amd64.  Ensure they stay in sync.

// Unusual type definitions.
// rune_t is declared to be an ``int'' instead of the more natural
// ``unsigned long'' or ``long''.  Two things are happening here.  It is not
// unsigned so that EOF (-1) can be naturally assigned to it and used.  Also,
// it looks like 10646 will be a 31 bit standard.  This means that if your
// ints cannot hold 32 bits, you will be in trouble.  The reason an int was
// chosen over a long is that the is*() and to*() routines take ints (says
// ANSI C), but they use __ct_rune_t instead of int.
//
// NOTE: rune_t is not covered by ANSI nor other standards, and should not
// be instantiated outside of lib/libc/locale.  Use wchar_t.  wint_t and
// rune_t must be the same type.  Also, wint_t should be able to hold all
// members of the largest character set plus one extra value (WEOF), and
// must be at least 16 bits.
