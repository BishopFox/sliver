You can search in all of the completions (history included therefore).

**Notes**
- Use `Ctr-G` or `Esc` to escape the current search.
- In History Mode, for instance, using a line will swap the existing line, so be careful with it.
- At the moment, there is a little problem with cycling through them: it will be solved soon, but remember it for now...
- The search pattern will apply to both candidates and their descriptions.

*Please note in this video the fact that the comps do not roll always perfectly, and that you might have to search and get back...*
