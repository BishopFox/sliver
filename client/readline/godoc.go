// Package readline is a pure-Go re-imagining of the UNIX readline API
//
// This package is designed to be run independently from murex and at some
// point it will be separated into it's own git repository (at a stage when I
// am confident that murex will no longer be the primary driver for features,
// bugs or other code changes)
