Console is an all-in-one console application library built on top of a [readline](https://github.com/reeflective/readline) shell and using [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) commands. 
It aims to provide users with a modern interface at at minimal cost while allowing them to focus on developing 
their commands and application core: the console will then transparently interface with these commands, and provide
the various features below almost for free.


## Features

### Menus & Commands 
- Bind cobra commands to provide the core functionality.
- Multiple menus with their own command tree, prompt engines and special handlers.
- All cobra settings can be modified, set and used freely, like in normal CLI workflows.
- Bind handlers to special interrupt errors (eg. `CtrlC`/`CtrlD`), per menu.

### Shell interface
- Shell is powered by a [readline](https://github.com/reeflective/readline) instance, with full `inputrc` support and extended functionality.
- All features of readline are supported in the console. It also allows the console to give:
- Configurable bind keymaps, commands and options, sane defaults, and per-application configuration.
- Out-of-the-box, advanced completions for commands, flags, positional and flag arguments.
- Provided by readline and [carapace](https://github.com/rsteube/carapace): automatic usage & validation command/flags/args hints.
- Syntax highlighting for commands (might be extended in the future).

### Others
- Support for an arbitrary number of history sources, per menu.
- Support for [oh-my-posh](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh) prompts, per menu and with custom configuration files for each.
- Also with oh-my-posh, write and bind application/menu-specific prompt segments.
- Set of ready-to-use commands (`commands/` directory) for readline binds/options manipulation.

## Status

The library is in a pre-release candidate status:
- Although quite simple and small, it has not been tested heavily.
- There are probably some features/improvements to be made.
- The API is quite stable. It is unlikely to change much in future versions.

Please open a PR or an issue if you wish to bring enhancements to it. 
Other contributions, as well as bug fixes and reviews are also welcome.
