Sliver
======

⚠️ __Warning:__ Sliver is currently in __alpha__, you've been warned :) and please consider [contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Sliver is a general purpose cross-platform implant framework that supports C2 over Mutual-TLS, HTTP(S), and DNS. Implants are dynamically compiled with unique X.509 certificates signed by a per-instance certificate authority generated when you first run the binary.

The server, client, and implant all support MacOS, Windows, and Linux (and possibly every Golang compiler target but we've not tested them all).

### Getting Started

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/releases) and see the Sliver [wiki](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/wiki/Getting-Started) for a quick tutorial on basic setup and usage. To get the very latest and greatest compile from source.

### Compile From Source

See the [wiki](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/wiki/Compile-From-Source).

### Source Code

The source code repo contains the following directories:

 * `assets/` - Static assets that are embedded into the server binary, generated by `go-assets.sh`
 * `client/` - Client code, the majority of this code is also used by the server
 * `protobuf/` - Protobuf code
 * `server/` - Server-side code
 * `sliver/` - Implant code, rendered by the server at runtime
 * `util/` - Utility functions that may be shared by the server and client
