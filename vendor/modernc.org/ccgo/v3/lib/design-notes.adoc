== Problems:

Translating C to Go is harder than it looks.

Jan says: It's impossible in the general case to turn C char* into Go
[]byte.  It's possible to do it probably often for concrete C code
cases - based also on author's C coding style. The first problem this
runs into is that Go does not guarantee that the backing array will
keep its address stable due to Go movable stacks. C expects the
opposite, a pointer never magically modifies itself, so some code will
fail.

== How the parser works

There are no comment nodes in the C AST. Instead every cc.Token has a
Sep field: https://godoc.org/modernc.org/cc/v3#Token

It captures, when configured to do so, all white space preceding the
token, combined, including comments, if any. So we have all white
space/comments information for every token in the AST. A final white
space/comment, preceding EOF, is available as field TrailingSeperator
in the AST: https://godoc.org/modernc.org/cc/v3#AST.

To get the lexically first white space/comment for any node, use
tokenSeparator():

The same with a default value is comment():

== Looking forward

Eric says: In my visualization of how the translator would work, the
output of a ccgo translation of a module at any given time is a file
of pseudo-Go code in which some sections may be enclosed by a Unicode
bracketing character (presently using the guillemot quotes U+ab and
U+bb) meaning "this is not Go yet" that intentionally makes the Go
compiler barf. This expresses a color on the AST nodes.

So, for example, if I'm translating hello.c with a ruleset that does not
include print -> fmt.Printf, this:

---------------------------------------------------------
#include <stdio>

/* an example comment */

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    printf("Hello, World")
}
---------------------------------------------------------

becomes this without any explicit rules at all:

---------------------------------------------------------
«#include <stdio>»

/* an example comment */

func main
{
	«printf(»"Hello, World"!\n"«)»
}
---------------------------------------------------------

Then, when the rule print -> fmt.Printf is added, it becomes

---------------------------------------------------------
import (
        "fmt"
)

/* an example comment */

func main
{
	fmt.Printf("Hello, World"!\n")
}
---------------------------------------------------------

because with that rule the AST node corresponding to the printf
call can be translated and colored "Go".  This implies an import
of fmt.  We observe that there are no longer C-colored spans
and drop the #includes.

// end
