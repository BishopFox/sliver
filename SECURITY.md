# Security Policy

One of the main goals of the Sliver project is to provide a secure platform when performing assessments, we encourage everyone to do a security review of the code base and report vulnerabilities, or to request features if the project does not meet your security needs.

### Bug Bounty

Anything in the `master` branch, without an open ticket.

| Severity | Reward  |
|---|---|
| Critical  |  12 Year Whisky or Scotch |
|  High | Good Beer  |
|  Medium | A PBR, Grain Belt, or Hamm's  |
|  Low | High Five |

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report high and/or critical vulnerabilities via email `jdemesy[a]bishopfox.com`, if no reponse within 14 days, file a ticket with a `security` tag. Medium to Low risk vulnerabilites can simply be filed as a normal bug/issue with the `security` tag.
