// This SDK is designed to work with clang and specific versions of
// gcc >= 4.0 with Apple's patch sets

// Compatibility with compilers and environments that don't support compiler
// feature checking function-like macros.

// The __CONCAT macro is used to concatenate parts of symbol names, e.g.
// with "#define OLD(foo) __CONCAT(old,foo)", OLD(foo) produces oldfoo.
// The __CONCAT macro is a bit tricky -- make sure you don't put spaces
// in between its arguments.  __CONCAT can also concatenate double-quoted
// strings produced by the __STRING macro, but this only works with ANSI C.

// __pure2 can be used for functions that are only a function of their scalar
// arguments (meaning they can't dereference pointers).
//
// __stateful_pure can be used for functions that have no side effects,
// but depend on the state of the memory.

// __unused denotes variables and functions that may not be used, preventing
// the compiler from warning about it if not used.

// __used forces variables and functions to be included even if it appears
// to the compiler that they are not used (and would thust be discarded).

// __cold marks code used for debugging or that is rarely taken
// and tells the compiler to optimize for size and outline code.

// __exported denotes symbols that should be exported even when symbols
// are hidden by default.
// __exported_push/_exported_pop are pragmas used to delimit a range of
//  symbols that should be exported even when symbols are hidden by default.

// __deprecated causes the compiler to produce a warning when encountering
// code using the deprecated functionality.
// __deprecated_msg() does the same, and compilers that support it will print
// a message along with the deprecation warning.
// This may require turning on such warning with the -Wdeprecated flag.
// __deprecated_enum_msg() should be used on enums, and compilers that support
// it will print the deprecation warning.
// __kpi_deprecated() specifically indicates deprecation of kernel programming
// interfaces in Kernel.framework used by KEXTs.

// __unavailable causes the compiler to error out when encountering
// code using the tagged function

// Delete pseudo-keywords wherever they are not available or needed.

// We use `__restrict' as a way to define the `restrict' type qualifier
// without disturbing older software that is unaware of C99 keywords.

// Compatibility with compilers and environments that don't support the
// nullability feature.

// __disable_tail_calls causes the compiler to not perform tail call
// optimization inside the marked function.

// __not_tail_called causes the compiler to prevent tail call optimization
// on statically bound calls to the function.  It has no effect on indirect
// calls.  Virtual functions, objective-c methods, and functions marked as
// "always_inline" cannot be marked as __not_tail_called.

// __result_use_check warns callers of a function that not using the function
// return value is a bug, i.e. dismissing malloc() return value results in a
// memory leak.

// __swift_unavailable causes the compiler to mark a symbol as specifically
// unavailable in Swift, regardless of any other availability in C.

// __abortlike is the attribute to put on functions like abort() that are
// typically used to mark assertions. These optimize the codegen
// for outlining while still maintaining debugability.

// Declaring inline functions within headers is error-prone due to differences
// across various versions of the C language and extensions.  __header_inline
// can be used to declare inline functions within system headers.  In cases
// where you want to force inlining instead of letting the compiler make
// the decision, you can use __header_always_inline.
//
// Be aware that using inline for functions which compilers may also provide
// builtins can behave differently under various compilers.  If you intend to
// provide an inline version of such a function, you may want to use a macro
// instead.
//
// The check for !__GNUC__ || __clang__ is because gcc doesn't correctly
// support c99 inline in some cases:
// http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55965

// Compiler-dependent macros that bracket portions of code where the
// "-Wunreachable-code" warning should be ignored. Please use sparingly.

// Compiler-dependent macros to declare that functions take printf-like
// or scanf-like arguments.  They are null except for versions of gcc
// that are known to support the features properly.  Functions declared
// with these attributes will cause compilation warnings if there is a
// mismatch between the format string and subsequent function parameter
// types.

// Source compatibility only, ID string not emitted in object file

// __alloc_size can be used to label function arguments that represent the
// size of memory that the function allocates and returns. The one-argument
// form labels a single argument that gives the allocation size (where the
// arguments are numbered from 1):
//
// void	*malloc(size_t __size) __alloc_size(1);
//
// The two-argument form handles the case where the size is calculated as the
// product of two arguments:
//
// void	*calloc(size_t __count, size_t __size) __alloc_size(1,2);

// COMPILATION ENVIRONMENTS -- see compat(5) for additional detail
//
// DEFAULT	By default newly complied code will get POSIX APIs plus
//		Apple API extensions in scope.
//
//		Most users will use this compilation environment to avoid
//		behavioral differences between 32 and 64 bit code.
//
// LEGACY	Defining _NONSTD_SOURCE will get pre-POSIX APIs plus Apple
//		API extensions in scope.
//
//		This is generally equivalent to the Tiger release compilation
//		environment, except that it cannot be applied to 64 bit code;
//		its use is discouraged.
//
//		We expect this environment to be deprecated in the future.
//
// STRICT	Defining _POSIX_C_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE restricts the
//		available APIs to exactly the set of APIs defined by the
//		corresponding standard, based on the value defined.
//
//		A correct, portable definition for _POSIX_C_SOURCE is 200112L.
//		A correct, portable definition for _XOPEN_SOURCE is 600L.
//
//		Apple API extensions are not visible in this environment,
//		which can cause Apple specific code to fail to compile,
//		or behave incorrectly if prototypes are not in scope or
//		warnings about missing prototypes are not enabled or ignored.
//
// In any compilation environment, for correct symbol resolution to occur,
// function prototypes must be in scope.  It is recommended that all Apple
// tools users add either the "-Wall" or "-Wimplicit-function-declaration"
// compiler flags to their projects to be warned when a function is being
// used without a prototype in scope.

// These settings are particular to each product.
// Platform: MacOSX

// The __DARWIN_ALIAS macros are used to do symbol renaming; they allow
// legacy code to use the old symbol, thus maintaining binary compatibility
// while new code can use a standards compliant version of the same function.
//
// __DARWIN_ALIAS is used by itself if the function signature has not
// changed, it is used along with a #ifdef check for __DARWIN_UNIX03
// if the signature has changed.  Because the __LP64__ environment
// only supports UNIX03 semantics it causes __DARWIN_UNIX03 to be
// defined, but causes __DARWIN_ALIAS to do no symbol mangling.
//
// As a special case, when XCode is used to target a specific version of the
// OS, the manifest constant __ENVIRONMENT_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED__
// will be defined by the compiler, with the digits representing major version
// time 100 + minor version times 10 (e.g. 10.5 := 1050).  If we are targeting
// pre-10.5, and it is the default compilation environment, revert the
// compilation environment to pre-__DARWIN_UNIX03.

// POSIX.1 requires that the macros we test be defined before any standard
// header file is included.  This permits us to convert values for feature
// testing, as necessary, using only _POSIX_C_SOURCE.
//
// Here's a quick run-down of the versions:
//  defined(_POSIX_SOURCE)		1003.1-1988
//  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 1L		1003.1-1990
//  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 2L		1003.2-1992 C Language Binding Option
//  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 199309L		1003.1b-1993
//  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 199506L		1003.1c-1995, 1003.1i-1995,
//					and the omnibus ISO/IEC 9945-1: 1996
//  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 200112L		1003.1-2001
//  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 200809L		1003.1-2008
//
// In addition, the X/Open Portability Guide, which is now the Single UNIX
// Specification, defines a feature-test macro which indicates the version of
// that specification, and which subsumes _POSIX_C_SOURCE.

// Deal with IEEE Std. 1003.1-1990, in which _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 1L.

// Deal with IEEE Std. 1003.2-1992, in which _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 2L.

// Deal with various X/Open Portability Guides and Single UNIX Spec.

// Deal with all versions of POSIX.  The ordering relative to the tests above is
// important.

// Set a single macro which will always be defined and can be used to determine
// the appropriate namespace.  For POSIX, these values will correspond to
// _POSIX_C_SOURCE value.  Currently there are two additional levels corresponding
// to ANSI (_ANSI_SOURCE) and Darwin extensions (_DARWIN_C_SOURCE)

// If the developer has neither requested a strict language mode nor a version
// of POSIX, turn on functionality provided by __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ as part
// of __DARWIN_C_FULL.

// long long is not supported in c89 (__STRICT_ANSI__), but g++ -ansi and
// c99 still want long longs.  While not perfect, we allow long longs for
// g++.

//
//  Public darwin-specific feature macros
//

// _DARWIN_FEATURE_64_BIT_INODE indicates that the ino_t type is 64-bit, and
// structures modified for 64-bit inodes (like struct stat) will be used.

// _DARWIN_FEATURE_64_ONLY_BIT_INODE indicates that the ino_t type may only
// be 64-bit; there is no support for 32-bit ino_t when this macro is defined
// (and non-zero).  There is no struct stat64 either, as the regular
// struct stat will already be the 64-bit version.

// _DARWIN_FEATURE_ONLY_VERS_1050 indicates that only those APIs updated
// in 10.5 exists; no pre-10.5 variants are available.

// _DARWIN_FEATURE_ONLY_UNIX_CONFORMANCE indicates only UNIX conforming API
// are available (the legacy BSD APIs are not available)

// _DARWIN_FEATURE_UNIX_CONFORMANCE indicates whether UNIX conformance is on,
// and specifies the conformance level (3 is SUSv3)

// This macro casts away the qualifier from the variable
//
// Note: use at your own risk, removing qualifiers can result in
// catastrophic run-time failures.

// __XNU_PRIVATE_EXTERN is a linkage decoration indicating that a symbol can be
// used from other compilation units, but not other libraries or executables.

// Architecture validation for current SDK

// Similar to OS_ENUM/OS_CLOSED_ENUM/OS_OPTIONS/OS_CLOSED_OPTIONS
//
// This provides more advanced type checking on compilers supporting
// the proper extensions, even in C.

// 7.18.4 Macros for integer constants

// 7.18.2 Limits of specified-width integer types:
//   These #defines specify the minimum and maximum limits
//   of each of the types declared above.
//
//   They must have "the same type as would an expression that is an
//   object of the corresponding type converted according to the integer
//   promotion".

// 7.18.2.1 Limits of exact-width integer types

//
//       Note:  the literal "most negative int" cannot be written in C --
//       the rules in the standard (section 6.4.4.1 in C99) will give it
//       an unsigned type, so INT32_MIN (and the most negative member of
//       any larger signed type) must be written via a constant expression.
//

// 7.18.2.2 Limits of minimum-width integer types

// 7.18.2.3 Limits of fastest minimum-width integer types

// 7.18.2.4 Limits of integer types capable of holding object pointers

// 7.18.2.5 Limits of greatest-width integer types

// 7.18.3 "Other"

// WCHAR_MIN should be 0 if wchar_t is an unsigned type and
//    (-WCHAR_MAX-1) if wchar_t is a signed type.  Unfortunately,
//    it turns out that -fshort-wchar changes the signedness of
//    the type.

//     These macros are for use in OS header files. They enable function prototypes
//     and Objective-C methods to be tagged with the OS version in which they
//     were first available; and, if applicable, the OS version in which they
//     became deprecated.
//
//     The desktop Mac OS X and iOS each have different version numbers.
//     The __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING() macro allows you to specify both the desktop
//     and iOS version numbers.  For instance:
//         __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_2,__IPHONE_2_0)
//     means the function/method was first available on Mac OS X 10.2 on the desktop
//     and first available in iOS 2.0 on the iPhone.
//
//     If a function is available on one platform, but not the other a _NA (not
//     applicable) parameter is used.  For instance:
//             __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_3,__IPHONE_NA)
//     means that the function/method was first available on Mac OS X 10.3, and it
//     currently not implemented on the iPhone.
//
//     At some point, a function/method may be deprecated.  That means Apple
//     recommends applications stop using the function, either because there is a
//     better replacement or the functionality is being phased out.  Deprecated
//     functions/methods can be tagged with a __OSX_AVAILABLE_BUT_DEPRECATED()
//     macro which specifies the OS version where the function became available
//     as well as the OS version in which it became deprecated.  For instance:
//         __OSX_AVAILABLE_BUT_DEPRECATED(__MAC_10_0,__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA,__IPHONE_NA)
//     means that the function/method was introduced in Mac OS X 10.0, then
//     became deprecated beginning in Mac OS X 10.5.  On iOS the function
//     has never been available.
//
//     For these macros to function properly, a program must specify the OS version range
//     it is targeting.  The min OS version is specified as an option to the compiler:
//     -mmacosx-version-min=10.x when building for Mac OS X, and -miphoneos-version-min=y.z
//     when building for the iPhone.  The upper bound for the OS version is rarely needed,
//     but it can be set on the command line via: -D__MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED=10x0 for
//     Mac OS X and __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED = y0z00 for iOS.
//
//     Examples:
//
//         A function available in Mac OS X 10.5 and later, but not on the phone:
//
//             extern void mymacfunc() __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA);
//
//
//         An Objective-C method in Mac OS X 10.5 and later, but not on the phone:
//
//             @interface MyClass : NSObject
//             -(void) mymacmethod __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_5,__IPHONE_NA);
//             @end
//
//
//         An enum available on the phone, but not available on Mac OS X:
//
//             #if __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED
//                 enum { myEnum = 1 };
//             #endif
//            Note: this works when targeting the Mac OS X platform because
//            __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED is undefined which evaluates to zero.
//
//
//         An enum with values added in different iPhoneOS versions:
//
// 			enum {
// 			    myX  = 1,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 2.1 and later
// 			    myY  = 2,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 3.0 and later
// 			    myZ  = 3,	// Usable on iPhoneOS 3.0 and later
// 				...
// 		      Note: you do not want to use #if with enumeration values
// 			  when a client needs to see all values at compile time
// 			  and use runtime logic to only use the viable values.
//
//
//     It is also possible to use the *_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED in source code to make one
//     source base that can be compiled to target a range of OS versions.  It is best
//     to not use the _MAC_* and __IPHONE_* macros for comparisons, but rather their values.
//     That is because you might get compiled on an old OS that does not define a later
//     OS version macro, and in the C preprocessor undefined values evaluate to zero
//     in expresssions, which could cause the #if expression to evaluate in an unexpected
//     way.
//
//         #ifdef __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED
//             // code only compiled when targeting Mac OS X and not iPhone
//             // note use of 1050 instead of __MAC_10_5
//             #if __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED < 1050
//                 // code in here might run on pre-Leopard OS
//             #else
//                 // code here can assume Leopard or later
//             #endif
//         #endif
//
//

// __API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED is used as a version number in API that will be deprecated
// in an upcoming release. This soft deprecation is an intermediate step before formal
// deprecation to notify developers about the API before compiler warnings are generated.
// You can find all places in your code that use soft deprecated API by redefining the
// value of this macro to your current minimum deployment target, for example:
// (macOS)
//   clang -D__API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED=10.12 <other compiler flags>
// (iOS)
//   clang -D__API_TO_BE_DEPRECATED=11.0 <other compiler flags>

// Types

// Option flags per-socket.
//  (ATOMIC proto)

// Additional options, not kept in so_options.

// When adding new socket-options, you need to make sure MPTCP supports these as well!

// Network Service Type for option SO_NET_SERVICE_TYPE
//
// The vast majority of sockets should use Best Effort that is the default
// Network Service Type. Other Network Service Types have to be used only if
// the traffic actually matches the description of the Network Service Type.
//
// Network Service Types do not represent priorities but rather describe
// different categories of delay, jitter and loss parameters.
// Those parameters may influence protocols from layer 4 protocols like TCP
// to layer 2 protocols like Wi-Fi. The Network Service Type can determine
// how the traffic is queued and scheduled by the host networking stack and
// by other entities on the network like switches and routers. For example
// for Wi-Fi, the Network Service Type can select the marking of the
// layer 2 packet with the appropriate WMM Access Category.
//
// There is no point in attempting to game the system and use
// a Network Service Type that does not correspond to the actual
// traffic characteristic but one that seems to have a higher precedence.
// The reason is that for service classes that have lower tolerance
// for delay and jitter, the queues size is lower than for service
// classes that are more tolerant to delay and jitter.
//
// For example using a voice service type for bulk data transfer will lead
// to disastrous results as soon as congestion happens because the voice
// queue overflows and packets get dropped. This is not only bad for the bulk
// data transfer but it is also bad for VoIP apps that legitimately are using
// the voice  service type.
//
// The characteristics of the Network Service Types are based on the service
// classes defined in RFC 4594 "Configuration Guidelines for DiffServ Service
// Classes"
//
// When system detects the outgoing interface belongs to a DiffServ domain
// that follows the recommendation of the IETF draft "Guidelines for DiffServ to
// IEEE 802.11 Mapping", the packet will marked at layer 3 with a DSCP value
// that corresponds to Network Service Type.
//
// NET_SERVICE_TYPE_BE
//	"Best Effort", unclassified/standard.  This is the default service
//	class and cover the majority of the traffic.
//
// NET_SERVICE_TYPE_BK
//	"Background", high delay tolerant, loss tolerant. elastic flow,
//	variable size & long-lived. E.g: non-interactive network bulk transfer
//	like synching or backup.
//
// NET_SERVICE_TYPE_RD
//	"Responsive Data", a notch higher than "Best Effort", medium delay
//	tolerant, elastic & inelastic flow, bursty, long-lived. E.g. email,
//	instant messaging, for which there is a sense of interactivity and
//	urgency (user waiting for output).
//
// NET_SERVICE_TYPE_OAM
//	"Operations, Administration, and Management", medium delay tolerant,
//	low-medium loss tolerant, elastic & inelastic flows, variable size.
//	E.g. VPN tunnels.
//
// NET_SERVICE_TYPE_AV
//	"Multimedia Audio/Video Streaming", medium delay tolerant, low-medium
//	loss tolerant, elastic flow, constant packet interval, variable rate
//	and size. E.g. video and audio playback with buffering.
//

// Constants and structures defined by the internet system,
// Per RFC 790, September 1981, and numerous additions.

// Protocols (RFC 1700)
// 55-57: Unassigned
// 101-252: Partly Unassigned
// 253-254: Experimentation and testing; 255: Reserved (RFC3692)
// BSD Private, local use, namespace incursion

// last return value of *_input(), meaning "all job for this pkt is done".

// Local port number conventions:
//
// When a user does a bind(2) or connect(2) with a port number of zero,
// a non-conflicting local port address is chosen.
// The default range is IPPORT_RESERVED through
// IPPORT_USERRESERVED, although that is settable by sysctl.
//
// A user may set the IPPROTO_IP option IP_PORTRANGE to change this
// default assignment range.
//
// The value IP_PORTRANGE_DEFAULT causes the default behavior.
//
// The value IP_PORTRANGE_HIGH changes the range of candidate port numbers
// into the "high" range.  These are reserved for client outbound connections
// which do not want to be filtered by any firewalls.
//
// The value IP_PORTRANGE_LOW changes the range to the "low" are
// that is (by convention) restricted to privileged processes.  This
// convention is based on "vouchsafe" principles only.  It is only secure
// if you trust the remote host to restrict these ports.
//
// The default range of ports and the high range can be changed by
// sysctl(3).  (net.inet.ip.port{hi,low}{first,last}_auto)
//
// Changing those values has bad security implications if you are
// using a a stateless firewall that is allowing packets outside of that
// range in order to allow transparent outgoing connections.
//
// Such a firewall configuration will generally depend on the use of these
// default values.  If you change them, you may find your Security
// Administrator looking for you with a heavy object.
//
// For a slightly more orthodox text view on this:
//
//            ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/port-numbers
//
//    port numbers are divided into three ranges:
//
//                0 -  1023 Well Known Ports
//             1024 - 49151 Registered Ports
//            49152 - 65535 Dynamic and/or Private Ports
//

// Ports < IPPORT_RESERVED are reserved for
// privileged processes (e.g. root).         (IP_PORTRANGE_LOW)
// Ports > IPPORT_USERRESERVED are reserved
// for servers, not necessarily privileged.  (IP_PORTRANGE_DEFAULT)

// Default local port range to use by setting IP_PORTRANGE_HIGH

// Scanning for a free reserved port return a value below IPPORT_RESERVED,
// but higher than IPPORT_RESERVEDSTART.  Traditionally the start value was
// 512, but that conflicts with some well-known-services that firewalls may
// have a fit if we use.
