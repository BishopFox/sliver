# This course is intended for the 1.6 version of Sliver, which is not yet published

`sliver-server` is the binary you want to use to run the Sliver C2 server, `sliver-client` is solely a client to connect to a Sliver C2 server. Sliver server also acts as a client on its own, so you don’t necessarily run sliver server and client separately.

First time running Sliver will take a couple seconds as it's retrieving its dependencies. Consecutive executions will be much faster. Go ahead and launch the `sliver-server`.

```asciinema
{"src": "/asciinema/startup.cast", "cols": "132", "rows": "28", "idleTimeLimit": 8}
```

Let's take a couple minutes to discuss what Sliver actually is and how it's set up.

Now that Sliver is running, lets generate and execute your first implant to try out some of the basic features of Sliver, for now we’re going to run everything on the local host.

Here's what we're going to do: 
* Generate your implant using the `generate` command as shown below.
* Start HTTP listener on port 80
* Execute implant in a separate terminal

```asciinema
{"src": "/asciinema/first-implant.cast", "cols": "132", "rows": "14", "idleTimeLimit": 8}
```

Now let’s select our implant and run our first command using the `use` command.

```bash
[server] sliver > use
? Select a session or beacon: 
SESSION  1884a365  RELATED_EARDRUM  [::1]:49153      test.local  tester  darwin/amd64
[*] Active session RELATED_EARDRUM (1884a365-085f-4506-b28e-80c481730fd0)

[server] sliver (RELATED_EARDRUM) > pwd

[*] /Users/tester/tools
```

Once you have reached this point, go ahead and explore some of the commands listed below. In each case, first check out the command's help using the **`-h`** flag then try it out!

```bash
Exploring and interacting with the filesystem

Filesystem
  cat               Dump file to stdout
  cd                Change directory

  download          Download a file
  grep              Search for strings that match a regex within a file or directory
  head              Grab the first number of bytes or lines from a file

  upload            Upload a file
```

```asciinema
{"src": "/asciinema/filesystem.cast", "cols": "132", "rows": "14", "idleTimeLimit": 8}
```

Getting some environmental information
```bash

  env               List environment variables
  getgid            Get session process GID
  getpid            Get session pid
  getuid            Get session process UID
  info              Get session info
  ping              Send round trip message to implant (does not use ICMP)
  whoami            Get session user execution context
```
Execute a binary

```asciinema
{"src": "/asciinema/execute.cast", "cols": "132", "rows": "14", "idleTimeLimit": 8}
```

Running an interactive shell

```asciinema
{"src": "/asciinema/shell.cast", "cols": "132", "rows": "14", "idleTimeLimit": 8}
```

Not all commands are supported for all operating systems or meant to be used on all operating systems, here are a few examples:

```
mount             Get information on mounted filesystems (only for Windows and Linux)
screenshot        Take a screenshot (only for Windows and Linux)
memfiles          List current memfiles (Linux only)
